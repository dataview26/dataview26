# 👋 Hi, I'm Jones  

### Research Engineer (Multi-Agent AI)

Welcome to my GitHub. I explore the intersection of **large language models (LLMs)**, **multi-agent systems**, and **emergent intelligence** — studying how intelligent systems can learn, collaborate, and evolve safely.

---

## 🔍 Current Focus

My ongoing research and experimentation center on:  

- Investigating the capabilities, limitations, and emergent behaviors of LLMs  
- Developing coordination and communication strategies for multi-agent systems  
- Examining security and reliability challenges in decentralized or autonomous agents  
- Exploring hybrid systems that combine reasoning, memory, and adaptive learning  

*(Due to the sensitive nature of my current work, some project details are not publicly available.)*

## ⚙️ Technical Interests

- Adaptive prompting and LLM optimization  
- Secure and collaborative agent design  
- Neural–symbolic integration  
- AI interpretability and alignment  
- Self-organizing computational systems
