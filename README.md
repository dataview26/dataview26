# 👋 Hi, I'm Jones 
### Research Engineer (Multi-Agent AI)

Welcome to my GitHub. I work at the intersection of **large language models (LLMs)**, **multi-agent systems**, and **emergent intelligence** — exploring how intelligent systems can learn, collaborate, and evolve safely.

---

###  Current Focus
My recent research has centered on:
- Understanding the **capabilities, limitations, and emergent behaviors** of LLMs  
- Investigating **multi-agent coordination and communication**  
- Exploring **security implications** in decentralized or autonomous agent frameworks  
- Studying **future potential** of hybrid systems combining reasoning, memory, and self-improvement

*(Due to the sensitive nature of my current work, project details are not publicly available.)*

### ⚙️ Technical Interests
- LLM optimization and adaptive prompting  
- Secure agent collaboration  
- Neural-symbolic integration  
- AI interpretability and alignment  
- Self-organizing computational systems

###  Beyond the Code
Outside research, I’m passionate about:
- **Deep learning ethics** and the societal impact of AI  
- **Experimental automation** and intelligent infrastructure  
- The long-term evolution of **synthetic cognition**
